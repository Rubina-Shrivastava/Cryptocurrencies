# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose:
### Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
The purpose of this analysis was to use data from CryptoCompare to provide a report and visualization of currently traded cryptocurrencies that can be grouped together to create a new classification system. This report would be used to help Accountability Accounting offer a new investment portfolio in the exciting world of cryptocurrency to its customers.

### The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. She’ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.
Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
## Results:
## Summary:
###   We did identify the classification 0f 531 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features The output is unknown, the best method would be unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms to group the currencies This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients
